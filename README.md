## Sensika Angular Developer Challenge

### Introduction
Imagine you just joined Sensika 7 years ago and we are now starting to develop our media monitoring solution.
In essence our newly founded company is collecting media content from lots of media outlets.

We want to create simple page with table like list of outlets for our source catalog management team. The list should have sortable columns and quick filters for filtering of the data.

#### Bonus points:
If we have some more hours, we will like to have the following items in our project:

* SCSS stylesheets
* NgRx or similar state management
* Sample detailed master/detail view using routes and/or popups

### Criteria
For full transparency, the test will be scored according to the following:

* Extendability to a real world scenario
* Can handle easily a lot of large lists of media outlets
* Reusable code
* Decoupled code
* Formatted code

* Can I use some open source templates? Yes
* Can I use custom project generator? Yes
* Can I use mock api instead of staic code loading? Yes
